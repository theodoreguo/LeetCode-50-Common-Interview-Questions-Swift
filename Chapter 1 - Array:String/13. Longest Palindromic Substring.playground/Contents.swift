/**
 Question:
 Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S. You may assume that the maximum length of S is 1000, and there exists one unique longest palindromic substring.
 
 Hint:
 First, make sure you understand what a palindrome means. A palindrome is a string which reads the same in both directions. For example, “aba” is a palindome, “abc” is not.

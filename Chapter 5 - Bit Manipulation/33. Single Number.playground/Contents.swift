/**
 Question:
 Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
 
 Note:
 Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
 
 Example Questions Candidate Might Ask:
 Q: Does the array contain both positive and negative integers? 
 A: Yes.
 Q: Could any element appear more than twice? 
 A: No.

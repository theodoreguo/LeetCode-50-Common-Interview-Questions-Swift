/**
 Question:
 Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.
 
 Hint:
 Things get a little more complicated when you have a singly linked list instead of an array. Please note that in linked list, you no longer have random access to an element in O(1) time.
 How about inserting nodes following the listâ€™s order? If we can achieve this, we no longer need to find the middle element, as we are able to traverse the list while inserting nodes to the tree.
